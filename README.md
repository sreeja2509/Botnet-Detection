The dataset I used for the project is CTU-13 dataset  and this dataset contains 13 observation and each observation contains PCAP files (This file contains all network information) and capture file (this file contains extracted information from PCAP files and this file contains data such as source address, destination address, time, packet size etc.). To generate graph we need to used capture file not PCAP file so I downloaded some observation and saved inside ‘CTU-13-dataset’ folder. Below are some samples from dataset observation file
